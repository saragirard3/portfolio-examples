# netflix_analysis_example

This example uses Python with Pandas and Matplotlib.pyplot. 

It pulls data from a csv prepared by Netflix for the user accounts. It allows the user to be able to enter the partial name title and see their analytics on that show.

It will pull up two graphs for days of the week most watched and hours of the day most watched.

This coding was based on a tutorial from Dataquest.io and can be found here:  https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-tutorial-analyze-personal-netflix-data/
